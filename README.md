# Getting started
In order to apply these Settings:
- For your project, go to the folder where you usually clone your git repositories (your Workspace) and copy `.vscode/` there.
- For your user, go to `~/.config/Code/` and copy the content of `User/*` there.

## Why bother
### About editor settings
```py
#TO-DO
```

### About formatting
Code is read much more often than it is written.
This is intended to improve the readability of code and make it consistent.

> Readability counts.

> Consistency with this style guide is important. However, know when to be inconsistent. Sometimes style guide recommendations just aren't applicable.
> When in doubt, use your best judgment. Look at other examples and decide what looks best. And don't hesitate to ask!
>
> In particular: do not break backwards compatibility just to comply with this PEP!
